# C-TextEditor
This project is meant to help me learn alot about the C programming language and managing memory. Also the datasctructures and algorithums that help to make up text editors.

It uses SDL2 for the redering and SDL_ttf for the fonts
This is meant to be a simple textEditor that can take in character input and save it to your machine.
I used a gap buffer for the main storage dataStructure.
